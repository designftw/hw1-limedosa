		<h2>Example 1: Lights Control System</h2>
		<img src="IMG_7021.jpg" alt="doors" style="width:160px;height:204px;">

		<!-- <img src="IMG_7023.jpg", scr="IMG_7028.jpg" alt="lights"style="width:160px;height:204;"> -->
		<p>The light controls showed in the pictures above demonstrate a perfect
			example of a problematic interface. Depicted is the epitome of simplicity
			and usability being sacraficed for the sake of making unecessary technological
			advances. The advances in this technological catastrophe are purely surface level.
			This control allows the lights to be dimmed and turned on and off. It allows control
			of sections of the room(e.g. one section can be turned off or dimmed and the other section
			can be turned on with maximum brightness). </p>
		<p>The issues adressed are no match for the usability
			lost by using this gadget. The dimensions of usability that suffer are learnability and
			efficiency. For learnability, it's essentially impossible to understand how to use the lights without
			having used the lights before. The way to use the lights is ambiguous in that the buttons don't provide
			much aid to the user for button-control memorization. The up and down arrows are designed to alter the
			brightness,
			but it's unclear which specific section of the room is being changed. The lioghtbulb is the "ON" button, but
			doesn't
			double as the "OFF" button, effectively highlighting the product's inconsistency. It's a rigorous process to
			learn how
			to use the light bulb, and so the poor learnability causes poor product efficiency. </p>
		<p>The inefficiency and learnability issues can be solved successfully if: the product is reprogrammed to be
			consistent in
			its buttons and get rid of unecessary buttons. The light bulb will turn the lights on and off, the
			brightness will be able
			to be adjusted with a dimmer(slider), rather than a button. The lights will also have assigned numbers to
			increase learnability
			of which light corresponds to which switch. A nice addition would be motion sensor technolgy, so users
			wouldn't have to fix the lighting if they don't want to. </p>

		<h2>Example 2: Cereal Dispenser </h2>
		<img src="IMG_7033.jpg" style="width:160px;height:204px;">
		<img src="IMG_7032.jpg" style="width:160px;height:204px;">

		<p>The cereal dispenser has a major flaw in its design. Although its interface is designed to accomodate easy
			use, it's constant failure to preform is where it's worst flaw lies.
			The dispenser releases cereal when the handle is pushed down; the concept is crystal clear and learnability
			isn't an issue. The issue with this interface lies in the cereal constantly getting stuck.
			It's extremely inneficient and hard to use. When cereal gets stuck, it's most often the larger pieces of
			cereal. It can be hypothesized that its interface is unssuportive of medium-large objects.
		</p>
		<p>The way to fix this interface is to alter it such that its interface is scaleable. In this case, that implies
			allowing larger pieces of cereal to be dispensed.
			A major problem with this is that a substantial portion of small pieces of cereal would be released if the
			release was made larger. One potential solution is to make differently sized exit extensions;
			that it allows for different sized cereal to exit according to the extension. Another part of the product
			that needs updating is the handle. The handle is so stiff it pulls the whole container down with it. The
			base of the container needs to be more steady to create a more efficient product. </p>
		<!-- <p>The showers depicted are fully functional. They don't have usability issues, but rather lack intricacy. To turn the shower on, users must turn the faucet to the left, and to turn it off; turn the faucet to the right.
		The main issue with the shower faucet system doesn't allow for users to alter the water pressure or how much water is released. It's</p> -->

		<h2>Example 3: Temperature Adjuster</h2>
		<div style="display: flex;">
			<img src="IMG_7027.jpg" style="width:160px;height:204px;">
			<img src="IMG_7023.jpg" style="width:160px;height:204px;">
			<img src="IMG_7028.jpg" style="width:160px;height:204px;">
		</div>
		<p>The Temperature adjuster depicted is a deeply flawed interface. It's essentially impossible to understand how
			it works or how to change the temperature.
			If a user isn't able to decipher the product within a reasonable amount of time, it's quite indicative of a
			flawed product. The temperature adjuster is an
			example of a product whose efficacy is impossible to judge because it's inusable. The biggest flaw in this
			product is learnability. Its information button yielded a screen
			with numbers that leave the user with more questions than answers. The product also has a lot of numbers
			constantly flashing, but no explanation. The numbers are sometimes accompanied by weather icons, but again;
			no explanation.
		</p>
		<p>The problem could be fixed by providing a clear information button that clarifies how to use the product.
			The only buttons needed besides that are the increasing temperature button and the decreasing temperature
			button.
			Pressing either of those should allow users to change the temperature. It would be useful to not have
			flashing numbers,
			but rather a screen that reads"Current Temperature", and when the temperature is being updated reads
			"updating temperature to:*set temperature*". </p>
