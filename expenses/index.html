	< <h2>Task1: Usability Problems</h2>
		The most important usability dimension for the app is arguably efficiency. Since this deals with money, it's
		most crucial that there be no erroneous aspects. The method has a huge learability issue. It's quite impossible
		to understand how to use the spreadsheet without explicit directions.<br />
		<br>The spreadsheet itself has a couple of logical flaws. One such flaw is the lack of a "Trinity owes" column. The
		variables column is unclear, but appears to be what Neo owes duplicated. The first and second columns"Trinity
		paid for Joint / Joint card paid for Neo" and "Neo paid for Joint / Joint card paid for Trinity", respectively
		appear to serve the same purpose. They don't divide the costs well. The only columns that are well made are the
		"Trinity paid for Neo" and "Neo paid for Trinity" columns.<br />
		<br>The issues affect all aspects of usability. The learnability issue can be fixed by making a clearer spreadsheet.
		This would entail making it such that all variables are absolutely necesssay. They'd probably include: "T paid
		for N", "N paid for T", "N owes T", "T owes N", "Joint to be split", "Joint, to be paid by T", "Joint to be paid
		by N". This allows for their joint accounts to have three different options; splitting the bill in half, Neo
		paying the bill in full(to be added to what Neo owes), and Trinity paying the bill(to be added to what Trinity
		owes).
		This update will allow for all usability issues to be fixed.

<h3>This code allows for each individual item to be split, from 0% to 100%, so one person can pay it all, pay nothing, or pay for a portion of it. All expenses will be totaled at the end.</h3>
